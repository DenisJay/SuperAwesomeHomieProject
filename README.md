# SuperAwesomeHomieProject
Just some awesome stuff we're gonna be doing here

What is this all about?
In this project we try to provide a clean and lightweight approach to simulating and visualizing kinematics. Using well-established technologies as foundation we aim to offer an easy-to-use machinery for your needs.
  - Importing of 3D-models
  - Defining the kinematic relationships (rotational and translational axes) 
  - Manipulating the model (P2P, Lin, ...)
  - Creating programs for real life usage
